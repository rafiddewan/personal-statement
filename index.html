            <h1>To The Recruiter Who Sees Thisâ€¦</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, and I appreciate the time you have taken out from your busy day to read this. My name is Rafid; I am a third-year software engineering student at Carleton University. <br>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img class="image" src="img/coffee.jpg">

            </p>
            <p>
                To start off, I was wondering what your favourite type of coffee is? An interesting study from a clinical <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/what-does-your-coffee-reveal-about-you/">psychologist conducted a study of 1000 coffee drinkers; assessing numerous characteristics and traits. I usually drink a latte every morning</a>. From the study shown, it shows that I go out of my way to help others and are generous with my time. Those traits are fairly accurate. You might be asking, "Why are you talking about coffee?" Coffee is a programmer's best friend to start the day, and during lunch, the type of coffee your employee drinks can give you a slight insight into what kind of personality traits your employee may have.

            <h1>Started from the bottom and now we are here</h1>
            <p>
                I first got my hands on code in grade 11. Learning how to code made me frustrated with myself and told my dad I'll never pick it up again. My teacher who taught nutrition class came to me and asked if I was still taking the computer science course in grade 12. She then asked me if it'd be possible to make a nutrition application for her so she can record her calorie intake progression. 
                <br>
                I was so excited that I contacted a friend of mine, and we began to make a nutrition application. It wasn't the best at the time; we created a fully-functional desktop application at the time and a half-completed Android application. I never had this much fun in my life. It instantly got me hooked to major in software engineering. The things I loved about software engineering the most doing something that will create an impact on helping others. That's the aspect of why I went from hating software engineering, to loving it so much.
            </p>

            <h1>Volunteering & Making an Impact on the Community</h1>
            <p>
                After high school, I wanted to make an impact on the community and inspire others around me. I wanted to strive to be a leader in a community. In doing so, I got involved with clubs such as  EWB, Carleton University Undergraduate Recruitment Office, IEEE Carleton, cuHacking, and IEEE SPAC. I was the Director of Logistics of cuHacking. I ensured the pre-planning and execution of the activities on the day-of for the MLH hackathon in 2019 go smoothly. The event had 450+ students, and I got to manage a team of eight engineering students and computer science students.

            <p>
                <br>
                Also, I was the Patronage Lead for IEEE SPAC 2019, which was a networking event. I managed a team of six engineering students, and we raised $22 000 for the event, with tons of companies attending and making connections with students at the event. I even got to become SPAC Lead the event the year after and grew the team from 12 organizing members to 28 organizing committee members, the event that year had almost 300 attendees.

                The Faculty of Engineering and Design awarded me for the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://newsroom.carleton.ca/story/two-students-recognized-with-adrian-chan-award-for-volunteer-and-community-service/">Dr. Adrian Chan Volunteer and Community Service Award</a>; the link contains an interview of my impact on the community since first year. I was also nominated from the IEEE Carleton Student Branch for the IEEE Larry K. Wilson Volunteer Award, which is a global award handed out to the most outstanding volunteers in the community. 
                <br>
                Shopify has always emphasized creating a welcoming community and a comfortable environment for their employees to work. Shopify helps establish the E-commerce platform for new or established enterprise businesses. Shopify even goes forward with assisting humanitarian needs such as <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/shopify-invites-developers-to-participate-in-app-challenge-to-help-businesses-fighting-covid-19/114876" >initiating developers to participate in app challenges to help companies to fight COVID-19</a>. I've also volunteered to compete myself!

            <h1>4 Months at Innovapost</h1>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2019, I worked at Innovapost for four months as a co-op student.
                <br>
                I was quite astonished by the product I was developing; This was an Active/Active directory in the procedure to move from a traditional in-house data center. I never had any experience in cloud development or automation experience going into this job. I worked in an agile/scrum environment using Ansible to automate resources on the Azure Cloud and schedule their tasks with AnsibleTower (such as deleting a VM gracefully). I assisted my manager in architecting the workflows of the creation, deletion, and update of several resources for an Active/Active data center at Innovapost. I utilized containerization tools such as Kubernetes and Docker to isolate builds of software packages and dependencies as well.
                <br>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img class="image" src="img/cloud.gif">
            </div>
            <p>
                It was especially a balanced mix that it was architecting, developing and testing my automation scripts. I was also running around between stakeholders to adjust to their requirements accordingly. Since I now gained a thorough understanding of DevOps.
                <br>
                Shopify is the leading cloud-based commerce platform in the world. I find that my skills in cloud automation and knowledge of Microsoft's best practices with Azure in a large-scale enterprise environment would serve to help the deployment of many massive DevOps products. 
            </p>
            <h1>Taking my skills to the test and competing with the rest</h1>
            <p>
                In August 2018, I competed in a tech entrepreneurship competition, called Sparkfest 2018. I led a team with two of my friends, and we brainstormed ideas of what we should make. We ended up thinking about a creative way for developers to do freelance work. Our product was called HackrTrackr. It was an Airbnb type application where you request someone to help you on a side project or troubleshoot a problem, once they do you have to rate them and give them a review. We won second place at Sparkfest 2018, and I got to meet incredible professionals, one of which was the guest speaker who was Jace Meyer, Shopify's Research and Development Education Lead at the time.

            <p>
                The next competition I was successful in was at cuHacking 2020. We developed a user-friendly web app called <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://devpost.com/software/house-hunter-d12ij6">House Hunter</a>. House Hunter optimizes a more straightforward way to find rental listings for students. We web scraped data from Kijiji real-time. Then used ML to find the best value for prices of apartment/house rentals that have a certain number of beds. We prototyped the design of our website using Figma. We then ended up winning the best UI/UX award at cuHacking 2020.

            <h1>Where I am currently</h1>
            <p>
                In my third year, I have explored all sorts of leadership roles. Now I have consolidated to more heavy technical impact-focused ones rather than just attending hackathons and competitions; I want to ensure my work is meaningful and has a long-lasting impact. I am currently volunteering as the official WebMaster of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ieeecanadianfoundation.org/EN/">IEEE Canadian Foundation</a>. I'm presently re-designing their front-end and back-end for the website and using prototype tools like Figma, looking into using modern JavaScript frameworks like React, and content management systems such as WordPress. I am contributing to an open-sourced application of Microsoft called PowerPlanner, for helping students like me manage their assignments, midterms, and schedule more optimally. I am also leading the development of a newly funded project by the department to take an autonomous vehicle from one side of the campus to the other side in tunnels. These are some of the new fresh initiatives and projects that I will be working on and hoping they can help the better to improve people's everyday life.

            <p>
                I am currently writing a book and will be releasing it next year! Most of my spare time goes into that right now.
