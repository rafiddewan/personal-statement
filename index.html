            <h1>To The Recruiter Who Sees Thisâ€¦</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I appreciate the time you have taken out from your busy day to read this. My name is Rafid; I am a third-year software engineering student at Carleton University. <br><br>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img class="image" src="img/coffee.gif">
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                To start off, I was wondering what your favourite type of coffee is? An interesting <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/what-does-your-coffee-reveal-about-you/">study</a> by a clinical psychologist with 1000 coffee-drinking participants. The psychologist assessed numerous characteristics and traits from those participants. I usually drink a latte every morning. From participating in this study myself, the results showed that I go out of my way to help others and I'm generous with my time. Those traits are fairly accurate. You might be asking, "Why are you talking about coffee?" Coffee is a programmer's best friend at the start of the day and during lunch. The type of coffee your employee drinks can give you a slight insight into what kind of personality traits your employee may have.

            <h1>Started From The Bottom And Now We Are Here</h1>
            <p>
                I first got my hands on code in grade 11. Learning how to code made me frustrated and I told my dad I'll never pick it up again. My teacher, who taught nutrition class, came to me and asked if I was still taking the computer science course in grade 12. She then asked me if it'd be possible to make a nutrition application for her so she can record her calorie intake progression.  
                <br>
                <br>
                I was so excited about this project that I contacted a friend of mine, and we began to make a nutrition application. It wasn't the best at the time; we created a fully-functional desktop application and a half-completed Android application. I never had this much fun in my life. It instantly got me thinking of majoring in software engineering. The thing I loved about software engineering the most was doing something that will create an impact and help others. That's the reason why I went from hating software engineering, to loving it so much.

            <h1>Volunteering & Making an Impact on the Community</h1>
            <p>
                After high school, I wanted to make an impact on the community and inspire others around me. I wanted to strive to be a leader in the engineering community. To do so, I got involved with clubs such as Engineers Without Borders, the Carleton University Undergraduate Recruitment Office, IEEE Carleton, cuHacking, and IEEE SPAC. I was the Director of Logistics of cuHacking 2019 (MLH Hackathon), where I ensured the pre-planning and execution of activities on the day-of went smoothly. Many students (including myself), were able to get employment opportunities. Other students had the opportunity to organize fantastic side-projects and explore their imagination. The event had 380+ students and 50 professionals. I got to manage a team of eight engineering students and computer science students.

            </div>
            <p>
                I was also the Patronage Lead for IEEE SPAC 2019, which was a networking event. This event was a networking sit-down dinner with two guest speakers. The dinner portion makes the event unique, since students are able to learn new career opportunities and gain deeper connections with professionals. I managed a team of six engineering students, and we raised $22 000 for the event, with tons of companies attending and making connections with students at the event. I even got to become SPAC Lead the year after and grew the comittee from 12 members to 28 members. I wanted the committee members to learn something new from being on the team so I developed workshops for networking, communication skills, entrepreneurship & finance management, as well as project management. I also brought my team close together through various team bonding events like hiking at Gatineau Park and organizing board games nights. The event for SPAC 2020 ended up being a success and we had almost 300 attendees.

                The Faculty of Engineering and Design awarded me for the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://newsroom.carleton.ca/story/two-students-recognized-with-adrian-chan-award-for-volunteer-and-community-service/">Dr. Adrian Chan Volunteer and Community Service Award</a> in 2019; the link provided contains an interview about my impact on the community since first year. I was also nominated from the IEEE Carleton Student Branch for the IEEE Larry K. Wilson Volunteer Award, which is a global award handed out to the most outstanding volunteers in the IEEE community.

                Shopify has always emphasized creating a welcoming community and a comfortable environment for their employees to work. Shopify helps establish the E-commerce platform for new or established enterprise businesses. Shopify even goes forward with assisting humanitarian needs such as <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/shopify-invites-developers-to-participate-in-app-challenge-to-help-businesses-fighting-covid-19/114876" >initiating developers to participate in app challenges to help companies fight COVID-19</a>. I've also volunteered to compete myself! I believe my values and volunteer experience to create a welcoming community is similar to the community Shopify creates for their employees as well.

            <h1>4 Months at Innovapost</h1>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2019, I worked at Innovapost for four months as a co-op student.
                <br>
                <br>
                I was quite astonished by the product I was developing. This was transitioning from a local in-house data center to two active remote ones. This helps large enterprises (such as Innovapost) to provide continuous operations for clients despite a bad storm causing an outage occuring in one of them (as the other would be at another location). I did not have any previous experience in cloud development or automation going into this job. I worked in an Agile/Scrum environment using Ansible to automate resources on the Azure Cloud and schedule their tasks with AnsibleTower (such as deleting a VM gracefully). 
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img class="image" src="img/cloud.gif">
            </div>
            <p>
                It was a balanced mix of tasks: architecting, developing and testing my automation scripts. I was also running around between stakeholders to adjust to their requirements accordingly. I'm very thankful for my co-op at Innovapost as I've gained a considerable amount of experience in DevOps.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shopify is the leading cloud-based commerce platform in the world. I find that my skills in cloud automation and knowledge of Microsoft's best practices with Azure in a large-scale enterprise environment would serve to help the deployment of many massive DevOps products.
            </p>
            <h1>Taking my skills to the test and competing with the rest</h1>
            <p>
                In August 2018, I competed in a tech entrepreneurship competition, called Sparkfest 2018. I led a team with two of my friends, and we brainstormed ideas of what we should make. We ended up thinking about a creative way for developers to do freelance work. Our product was called HackrTrackr. It was an Airbnb type application where you request someone to help you on a side project or troubleshoot a problem, once they do you have to rate them and give them a review. We won second place at Sparkfest 2018, and I got to meet incredible professionals, one of which was the guest speaker who was Jace Meyer, Shopify's Research and Development Education Lead at the time.

            <p>
                The next competition I took place in was cuHacking 2020. We developed a user-friendly web app called <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://devpost.com/software/house-hunter-d12ij6">House Hunter</a>. House Hunter optimizes a more straightforward way to find rental listings for students. We web scraped data from Kijiji real-time. Then, we used ML to find the best value for the prices of apartment/house rentals that have a certain number of beds. We prototyped the design of our website using Figma. We then used React.JS and the Material UI framework to implement the frontend. At the end of cuHacking 2020, we won the best UI/UX award.

            <h1>Where I Am Currently</h1>
            <p>
                In my third year, I have explored all sorts of leadership roles. Now I have consolidated to more heavy technical impact-focused roles, rather than just attending hackathons and competitions; I want to ensure my work is meaningful and has a long-lasting impact.  I am currently volunteering as the official WebMaster of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ieeecanadianfoundation.org/EN/">IEEE Canadian Foundation</a>. I'm presently re-designing their frontend and backend for the website and using prototype tools like Figma, looking into using modern JavaScript frameworks like React, and content management systems such as Refinery CMS (Ruby on Rails). I am contributing to an open-sourced application of Microsoft called PowerPlanner, for helping students like me manage their assignments, midterms, and schedule more optimally. I am also leading the development of a newly funded project by the Department of Systems and Computer Engineering at Carleton University to take an autonomous vehicle from one side of the campus to the other side in tunnels. These are some of the new, fresh initiatives and projects that I will be working on and hoping they can help the better to improve people's everyday life.

            <h1>What Do I Do In My Spare Time? </h1>
            <p>
                I am currently writing a book and will be releasing it next year! Most of my spare time goes into that right now. I used to love Percy Jackson and learning about Greek and Roman religions and myths. I want to bring knowledge and westernize Islam and Hindu mythology as I find those so fascinating but overlooked.
